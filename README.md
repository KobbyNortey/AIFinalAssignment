## AIFinalProject README

### Project Title: AIFinalProject

---

### Project Description
This project focuses on implementing AI techniques to predict specific outcomes based on the provided datasets. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

---

### Folder Structure
The project repository is structured as follows:
```
AIFinalProject/
│
├── predictor.py             # Main Python script for prediction
├── Datasets/                # Folder containing datasets used in the project
├── Models/                  # Folder containing trained models
├── Static/                  # Folder containing static files (e.g., images)
├── Templates/               # Folder containing template files
├── README.md                # README file (this document)

```

### Usage


- **Running the predictor script:**
  ```
  python predictor.py
  ```
---

### Dataset
The `Datasets` folder contains the datasets used in this project. Please ensure that the datasets are in the correct format and properly preprocessed before use.

---

### Models
The `Models` folder contains the pre-trained models. You can load these models for prediction or further training.

---

### Results
Results of the model predictions and evaluations will be stored in the `Results` folder. You can find detailed performance metrics and visualizations in this directory.
